I will provide you with a piece of text describing potential blockchain transactions. Please extract all relevant transaction details and output them as an array of JSON objects. Each object should represent **one transaction** and must contain the following fields:

1. "actionType": the transaction type (e.g., "transfer", "mint", "burn", "approve", "swap", "stake"), or "unknown" if not stated.
2. "chain": the blockchain or network name (e.g., "Ethereum", "BSC", "Polygon"), or "unknown" if not stated.
3. "fromAddress": the sender’s address, or "unknown" if not stated.
4. "toAddress": the recipient’s address, or "unknown" if not stated.
5. "token": the token or asset involved (e.g., "ETH", "USDT", "NFT ID"), or "unknown" if not stated.
6. "amount": the quantity or amount to be transacted, or "unknown" if not stated.
7. "notes": any additional comments or descriptions regarding the transaction. Use an empty string "" if there is nothing to add.

### Sample JSON Output

[
  {
    "actionType": "transfer",
    "chain": "Ethereum",
    "fromAddress": "0x123...",
    "toAddress": "0xabc...",
    "token": "USDT",
    "amount": "100",
    "notes": ""
  },
  {
    "actionType": "stake",
    "chain": "Polygon",
    "fromAddress": "0x111...",
    "toAddress": "StakingContractAddress",
    "token": "MATIC",
    "amount": "50",
    "notes": "Staking for liquidity mining"
  }
]

### Important Instructions
1. Return your final answer strictly as valid JSON, **without** extra text or explanations.
2. If no transaction-related activity is found in the text, return an **empty JSON array**: [].
